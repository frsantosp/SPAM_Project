ham,Subject: summary - judge ' s recommendation re retroactive refundscommenting on his general perception of the settlement conference , the chief judge , in his down home manner , did not miss the opportunity to say that " you can take a horse to water but you can ' t make him drink . " below is a cliff notes version of the judge ' s report and recommendation issued at 4 : 49 pm today . attached is the complete work .the judge opined that very large refunds would be due - " while the amount of such refunds is not $ 8 . 9 billion as claimed by the state of california , they do amount to hundreds of millions of dollars , probably more than a billion dollars in an aggregate sum . ? at the same time , while there are vast sums due for overcharges , there are even larger amounts owed to energy sellers by the caiso , the investor owned utilities , and the state of california . can a cash refund be required where a much larger amount is due the seller ? the chief judge thinks not . " another notable quote : " ? it is the opinion of the chief judge that the amount claimed by the state of california has not and cannot be substantiated . "the judge noted that he submitted a proposal of his own on july 5 , which was summarily rejected by the state of california , and that the five separate offers of the various industry groups to settle with california were also rejected .refund effective date - refund effective date of october 2 , 2000 , for sales in the spot markets of the caiso and the cal px . the chief judge ' s recommendations do not go beyond that date . " spot market " sales are " sales that are 24 hours or less and that are entered into the day of or day prior to delivery . "evidentiary hearing - " the differences between what the state of california believes the buyers in the california markets are owed in refunds and what the sellers in the california market believe should be refunded raise material issues of fact . the appropriate numbers to calculate potential refunds involve factual disputes . thus , the chief judge recommends that a trial - type , evidentiary hearing be ordered limited to a factual record to apply to the methodology set forth below . because of the urgent need for an answer to the refund issues that hearing should be on a 60 - day fast track schedule . it is important that a single methodology be adopted for calculating potential refunds in this proceeding . however , such a methodology may not be appropriate for all sellers in the caiso ' s and cal px ' s spot markets in an after - the - fact refund calculation . in any event , sellers not using the methodology should bear the burden of demonstrating that their costs exceeded the results of the methodology recommended herein over the entire refund period . "methodology - the chief judge recommends that the methodology set forth in the june 19 th order be used with the modifications discussed below in order to calculate any potential refunds that may be due to customers in the caiso ' s and cal px ' s spot energy and ancillary service markets for the period october 2 , 2000 through may 28 , 2001 .heat rate - the actual heat rates , rather than hypothetical heat rates ( associated with recreating the must - bid requirement of the june 19 th order ) provide the first step in calculating the cost of the marginal unit .gas cost - the gas costs associated with the marginal unit should be based upon a daily spot gas price . " in the event that the marginal unit is located in npl 5 ( north of path 15 ) , the daily spot gas price for pg & e citygate and malin should be averaged with the resulting gas price multiplied by the marginal unit ' s heat rate to calculate a clearing price for that hour . if the marginal unit is located in spl 5 ( south of path 15 ) , the daily spot gas price for southern california gas large packages should be multiplied by the marginal unit ' s heat rate to calculate a clearing price for that hour . the daily spot gas prices should be for the " midpoint " as published in financial times energy ' s " gas daily " publication for the aforementioned delivery points . the last published gas prices should be used in calculating the refund price for the days that gas daily is not published ( weekends and holidays ) . "o & m adder - an adder of $ 6 / mwh for o & m should also be included with the calculated market clearing price .emissions costs - demonstrable emission costs should be excluded from the market clearing price and treated as an additional expense that sellers may subtract from their respective refund calculation .credit adder - the 10 percent adder should be included in the market clearing price for all transactions that occurred after january 5 , 2001 when pg & e and socal edison were deemed no longer creditworthy .ancillary services - consistent with the june 19 th order , ancillary service prices would be capped at the market clearing price established in the real - time imbalance energy market . adjustment bids would also be treated the same as set forth in the june 19 th order .maximum price for non - emergency hours - somewhat unclear . the chief judge recommends that for purposes of recreating a competitive market for calculating refunds , the refund methodology should deviate from the 85 % non - emergency requirement of the june 19 th order . to measure the amount that actual prices may have exceeded the refund price , every hour should be recalculated .offsets - " recalculating the hourly competitive price for purposes of a refund calculation would also permit the cal px and caiso to resettle all charges for the refund period . amounts owed to sellers and outstanding amounts due from buyers would be recalculated . any refunds could then be offset against accurate amounts receivable without sellers netting out any of their purchases from the caiso and cal px during the refund period . "interest - interest should not be charged against any refund amounts unless the refund amount exceeds the amounts that are past due to the seller .

ham,Subject: caiso notification - ct 1487 - energy exchange program neutralityadjustmentenergy exchange program neutrality adjustmentcharge type 1487sc settlement contacts :backgroundas you may know , the energy exchange program began on tradedate 11 / 14 / 2000 . in this program the iso obtained needed energy in for thereal time market and , rather that paying for the energy as a purchase , laterreturned the energy in another period . this was not necessarily aone - for - one exchange . the incoming energy created a positive neutralityadjustment and when the energy was returned , a negative neutralityadjustment ensued . since the incoming and outgoing energy were usuallyvalued differently , there was a cost shift associated with the transactionthat was not cash neutral to the iso . the iso created charge type 1487 wasdeveloped for the allocation of the cost to scs participating in the marketduring the incoming schedulesnotificationthe iso has created charge type 1487 so that whenever anenergy exchange account is closed or reaches a zero balance , the incurredcosts will be calculated and allocated to the sc ' s based on their totalnegative uninstructed energy over those intervals in which the incomingschedules took place . this new charge type will appear beginning on thejune 30 , 2001 statements which will be published on august 23 , 2001 . inaddition a few accounts reached a zero balance as early as december , 2000and therefore allocations may or may not appear on your statement with thererun data .ct 1487 is a semi automated charge , meaning that thecollection of energy data is automated , but it will be a manual charge typewithin the manual line item records and will not require a change to yoursettlement system . note that this charge will not appear on everystatement , but only when an energy exchange account is closed or reaches azero balance .if you have any questions , please contact your clientrelations account manager .client relations communicationcrcommunications @ caiso . com

ham,Subject: forward obligations report issuesbill -following are two glitches the real time group has run across with the forward obs report . as i understand , dave poston is getting set to roll out a new version of enpower position manager , which may eventually take the place of many of the reports we run ( forward obs included ) , but in the meantime these are the problems we ' ve seen . thanks so much for your help on this !1 . report not reading two identical strips - when deals are extended in scheduling for the same hours , same volume , same price and same counterparty ( using the same deal number ) , the report only reads one strip . for example , on 8 / 6 / 01 , deal 718320 was previously entered as a sale to the california imbalance for 50 mw he 7 - 12 and two separate but identical strips of 25 mw for he 13 - 22 . the report read all 50 mw he 7 - 12 , but only 25 mw he 13 - 22 . i zeroed out one 25 mw strip and aggregated it with the other so the report would read all 50 mw .another example , on 8 / 4 / 01 , deal 718205 is a purchase from ees he 21 - 22 which was also entered as two separate strips of 25 mw each . again , the report read only one of these , and i eventually zeroed out one strip and aggregated it with the other so the report would read a total of 50 mw for those hours .due to the nature of real time deal entry - high volume and a lot of deal extension in scheduling - it would be impractical to aggregate volumes within deals that fall in the same hours at the same price . so i ' m hoping this can be remedied by tweaking the report to read strips with identical terms . please let me know if this is feasible .2 . report not reading sales at the bc border - this is a new one that cropped up this morning . we made a purchase from a counterparty at the bpa busbar , wheeled the power to the bc border and sold it there . for some reason , although all three deals ( 724366 / 724368 / 724367 ) appear in deal entry and scheduling , the sale at the bc border does not show up in the forward obligation report . after looking into this , i ' ve found no deal entry errors and can only conclude that deal 724367 is simply not pulling into the report . i ' m wondering if this is related to deals done at the bc border , although i don ' t recall seeing this problem before .again , please let me know when and if these report problems can be addressed . i look forward to our next conference call . . . .thanks ,kate symesreal time trading support503 - 464 - 3939

ham,Subject: re : meter 984229 - roos common point - trade zone 18vance :per our conversation , we have two possible options to resolve this deal ,depending on whether the wellheads are producing or not .producing : if that is the case , the purchase from calpine , and any contractshedged to it will need to be backed up in the system to a wellhead level .once that is done , i will need to research in the system how those wellheadswere allocated and paid and reallocate to your calpine deal . this willprobably have to go back to hplc ' s ownership of hplr ' s gathering assets .non - producing : should we determine that the common point and any wellsbehind it have been shut - in , or p & a ' d , we will need to reallocate this dealto zero , and unwind any hedges against it ( or , move the hedges to anotherdeal , if possible . since the deal is older , we probably sold lower pricedcontracts against the production and a buy - back today would possibly resultin a financial loss ) .in either case , the deal needs to be cleaned up back to the date of last flowat meter 4229 , which i am currently looking into . i will email you as soonas i ascertain that date .in lieu of the past couple of days , we may need to look at all of the dealswhich were impacted by hplc ' s aquisition of hplr ' s gathering to ensure thatthey are being captured properly , both at a book level and at a state filinglevel . please let me know what your thoughts are as to how to accomplishthis .thank you again for all of your hard work in this area ,mary

"( emphasis added . )further , support for relying on marginal rather than average costs comes fromthe commission itself . in its order of march 30 , 1979 setting this cause forhearing , mimeo at 4 , 5 , the commission , in commenting on time of day andseasonal rates , mentioned that it encourage innovative rate design to matchmore closely rates to costs . in this regard , the commission cited its orderno . 537 , supra at 4 , which specifically suggests use of pricing mechanismsbased on marginal cost principles[ 65 , 236 ]for jurisdictional wholesale sales . under the circumstances in this case ,where the sale of economy energy is related to edison ' s costs in adding oreliminating additional excess capacity , it is appropriate to establish theprice for economy transactions on marginal costs . this provides a more closematching of the rate to the cost than would a rate design based on averagecosts . accordingly , winnetka ' s position on pricing of economy energy will notbe adopted .affirmed and reversed - see next paragraphcomm - opinion - order , 23 ferc ?

ham,Subject: northern natural gasyesterday , enron settled a procedural dispute with dynegy over northern natural gas . our settlement allows dynegy to exercise its option to acquire the pipeline , dismisses their texas lawsuit and extends enron ' s right to repurchase until june 30 . we reached this settlement as part of our efforts to bring enron out of bankruptcy . while we would like to keep northern natural , we still have some 9 , 000 miles of safe , profitable interstate pipelines as a base to rebuild our core businesses .the settlement provides the best opportunity to resolve the pipeline issue quickly and pursue our $ 10 billion damage claim against dynegy . it also allows us to avoid the very substantial costs and distractions from protracted litigation in state courts .we want to see a positive future for the employees working with northern natural gas . below is a copy of a message from stan horton further explaining this decision to the employees of enron transportation services .kendear ets colleague :on thursday , enron entered into a settlement over dynegy ' s exercise of its option to acquire the northern natural gas pipeline . the settlement allows dynegy to exercise the option and assume interim control of the pipeline while enron pursues its damage claim against dynegy .in this respect , enron corp . has carefully weighed the substantial costs and turmoil that litigating this possession issue would create for the company and the employees of northern natural gas . consequently , enron corp . has decided not to contest interim possession and allow the transfer of northern natural gas to dynegy , while the larger issues affecting its future are resolved .the company has concluded that with this settlement , enron should be able to resolve the issue more quickly , as well as avoid the legal cost burden and distractions to the business from protracted litigation in state court . for the northern natural gas employees , i believe this decision should allow them to steer clear of the dispute and focus on the day - to - day satisfaction of running a valuable , successful business .beginning immediately we will be working to achieve a smooth transition and to align the appropriate resources to assure continued safe , reliable and efficient operation of northern natural gas .over many years we have run high quality , cost conscious and profitable businesses in ets . keep up the good work !stan

spam,Subject: why i love unverifiable voting machines , by the prez .how i stole your electionby george w . bushthe first thing i did to steal your election was to make friends with all the manufacturers and code - verifyers of the electronic voting machines . they were really nice , especially diebold who gave me $ 600 , 000 for my campaign . wow , thanks dude !next , i had my attack dog , karl rove , convince these companies to either alter the vote totals on the central tabulator machines ( simple pcs running windows using remote access server - - ras ) , or reprogram ( via a downloadable software patch ) the voting machines themselves so that they would give the advantage to me ! isn ' t america great ? ! ? a little money and some religious zealotry goes a looooong , loooong way . oh , the religious zealotry thing ? that ' s just a cover . i ' m not really a christian - - or at least i don ' t act like one . anyway , i digress .did you ever hear the media complaining about how inaccurate the exit polls were in prior elections ? no . that ' s because they basically are accurate . but this election , the exit polls showed kerry way ahead . no problem . my buddies rigged the machines ( and all they needed to do was rig it in one state , ohio , but they took care of at least florida for me too ) not only to make me squeak by in the important battleground states , like florida and ohio , but they also made sure that when i did get a state that i was expected to win , the margin was huge so that my popular vote would make it look like i had a mandate .so let ' s recap how the popular vote thing worked again . let ' s say we didn ' t want it to look suspicious by taking states that kerry really would have won ( except for ohio and florida , gotta take those ! heh heh ) . so we let him win there , but in order once again to boost the popular vote ( i put that in quotes because as you know , i ' m not really popular ) , we bring my vote tallies right up next to kerry ' s , to jack up the popular vote as much as possible , even if i didn ' t win the state .then , with states like north carolina , we know we ' re going to steal the state anyway ( at least according to what the exit polls were telling everyone . . . . and according to the long , long lines of new voters were telling everyone . . . because we all know most of those people were voting for kerry , not the status quo ) , so we just jack the crap out of the vote total to really stuff a crapload of popular votes in my pocket . you see , this way i can get on the tv and declare that i have a mandate and that i ' m going to cash in on my political capital ( which i don ' t really have of course , but we made it look that way ) .here ' s a nice chart to show you what i mean . take special note of how the electronic voting machine totals compare to the paper ballot totals . and see what i mean about north carolina ?look folks , if you really want me out of office , first you ' re going to have to impeach me . but you know what , if you don ' t have verifiable paper trails at the polls like these folks recommend ( http : / / . org / ) , and if you don ' t take these voting machines out of the hands of private companies that are aligned with one end of the political spectrum , then i ' m gonna just continue to hose you ( and then my brother jeb will be president too cause we ' re into this dynasty thing , kind of like my buddies the saudis . . . ain ' t it cool ? ! ? ) . also , in 2006 , we ' re going to steal about five more senate seats , and then we ' ll have the super - majority . that means the democrats can ' t do that confounded fillerbs . . . fillas . . . . fillbusters . . . . crap , well , they can ' t get in the darn way any more and we can pass any laws we want about anything and put whoever we want on the supreme court . ha ha , then you ' re really screwed . so if you don ' t fix this mess ( i mean great system ) in two years and have a verifiable voting system nationwide , america is mine ! ! ! ! ! ( and jeb ' s and my daddy ' s and cheney ' s and rove ' s . . . hey , we could even pass a law saying i could be president for four more years after 2008 ! that would be sooo cool ! ) anyway , i digress once again .and that pesky bev harris . man i wish she would go away . if too many of you contribute to her cause , i might just get in trouble so knock it off ! !http : / / www . blackboxvoting . org /i ' ve said it before and i ' ll say it again , fool me once . . . . . , oh crap , i forgot again . well how about this ? this would be a heck of lot easier if this was [ grammar incorrect ] a dictatorship . . . . just so long as i ' m the dictator . heh , heh . well , sorry to say folks , but i got my way . what are you gonna do about it , huh ? bring it on ! ! !sincerely yours ,president george w . bushp . s . pass it on ! i dare ya .

spam,Subject: we candate : september 21 , 2004 .sir ,detailsduring the regime of president charles taylor in liberia , i was the special adviser to the president on minerals and allied matters . also , i was made the chairman of the presidential task force on sales and exportation of diamonds and other gem stones , which are the major mineral deposits in liberia .the above positions availed me the opportunity to divert some fund , which was deposited with a private security vault firm in europe . this i did due to the instability in liberia during the regime of charles taylor , in order to safeguard my future and the future of my entire family .you may be aware of the protracted war in liberia . the political uncertainty is very unfriendly . the government of charles taylor , under which i served , had been discredited by the western world , especially the united states who forcefully removed the president and his cabinet and sent them to exile . this is the reason why i am in asylum in the nigeria being a top member of charles taylor? ? ts cabinet .thank god , the intention for which i diverted the fund was instantly justified at the inception of a new transition government . all the members of the former regime , including me , were put under probe . our assets were confiscated . all traceable bank accounts , both in liberia and overseas , were frozen , pending the findings of the probe committee or probable pardon by the new regime .my only fund that could not be traced is the fund i diverted to the private security vault company in netherlands . the deposit was made in the form of ? ? � concealed lodgment? ? � and the deposit manifest was made as diamonds and family treasures . the only person that is aware of this deposit is my personal lawyer , who i can trust , and you , who i have just told in utmost confidence . please , let it be so and may god help us .the amount in question is usd $ 15 million ( fifteen million dollars ) .this is the fund i want to invest , through an honest and trusted ally , in any good business in any country outside the continent of africa . this necessitated my search for a competent and reliable person who will oversee the investment on the basis of a joint venture partnership for our mutual benefit . my initial idea was to invest this fund in real estate . but your choice of any other business eitherin your country in any other country other than africa will be appreciated .the details of the partnership terms will be drafted by my lawyer on confirmation of your willingness to assist in this venture . also , a meeting could be arranged between you and my lawyer who is based here . this will enable us sign a memorandum of understanding before the fund will be transferred from the security vault company to your custody .i look forward to your prompt response as i wish to move this fund out of the vault company due to high cost of deposit contract renewal .regards .please replyonly through this email address : nathanielbarnes @ sify . comyours truly , nathaniel barneswalla ! mail - get your free lg mail today  
